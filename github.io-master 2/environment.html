            <p>Every year, 14 BILLION pounds of <b>trash</b> are dumped in the ocean. This trash can be chemicals, plastic, waste, metal, it can be <u>anything!</u> It clogs beatiful beaches, then goes on to hurt many, including sealife. Harmless creatures such as the turtle below, get trapped in these horrible plastic nets. Tons more animals also get stuck in plastic six-pack rings, and chemicals can damage their internal systems.</p>

     But that's not all! Pollution from chemical and smog have a lot of bad effects too. All this smog is harmful to our health, and can even cause asthma!
